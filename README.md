# Quadratic Equation Solver
This is a simple application for calculating quadratic equations. Just run the program to enter interactive mode(`node main.js`), or specify the path to the file where the data is located(`node main.js <filename>`).

## Requirements:
- **Node.js**: any modern version(I use 22.13);
- **OS**: tested on Linux, but I think it will work on all platforms.

## File Format:
The file format consists of 3 numbers separated by one space character. Examples:
- 1 1 1
- -2 1.3 3
- 1 -3.3 0
